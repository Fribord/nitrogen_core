COMPILING THE NITROGEN DOCUMENTATION


Compiling the documentation uses Org-mode for Emacs.

Editing the HTML is not recommended, as the org-mode compiler just overwrites all HTML anyway.

Instead, edit the org-mode files found in doc/org-mode.

Make sure you have emacs installed, with the htmlize[1] (version 1.34 or later), erlang-mode, and org-mode installed.

On Ubuntu, these packages can all be installed with:

sudo apt-get install emacs erlang-mode org-mode emacs-goodies-el


Once this is done, you can compile the docs from the command line with:

$ make docs

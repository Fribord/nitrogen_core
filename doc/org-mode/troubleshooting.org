* Common Questions when Troubleshooting Nitrogen Apps

* What tools do I need for troubleshooting Nitrogen apps?
# <<0>>

  Here are a few recommendations:

  + Have =sync= running. (run in the Erlang shell with =sync:go()=)

  + Have a browser with decent Javsacript debugging and network inspecting
    (Chrome's inspector, Firebug for Firefox, etc). Because Nitrogen does a lot
    of AJAX requests, you'll be watching those requests happen, and when or if
    they error out, you'll see those changes.

  + Don't be afraid to use Nitrogen's log handler with: =wf:info/1,2=,
    =wf:warning/1,2=, or =wf:error/1,2= , or send Erlang terms formatted as
    strings to the javascript console with =wf:console_log/1,2=.

  + Finally, when you're really not sure, don't be afraid to dig into the
    nitrogen source code to see what's going on.
